# Cold Start Playbook (First 100 Advisors → First 1,000 Leads)

## Goal

Seed supply fast in AU financial + property advisor categories, without waiting for demand.

---

## Phase 1 — Seed Inventory (Week 1–2)

### 1) Manual Seeding (MVP)

- Create initial Business + Listing records from publicly available sources (no automation required).
- Sources:
  - ASIC Financial Advisers Register (FAR) via MoneySmart
  - State property licence registers (NSW, VIC, QLD)
  - Google Maps / business directories
- Focus on **NSW + VIC first** (highest density), then expand.

### 2) Verification-as-a-Hook

- Offer "Basic Verified" badge quickly (ABN + proof-of-control).
- Promote "Licence Verified" as a premium trust badge.

---

## Phase 2 — Acquire Advisors (Week 2–6)

### Primary Channel: Outbound + Referral Loops

**Outbound list building:**

- Buyer's agents, mortgage brokers, financial advisers in top suburbs/postcodes.
- Use LinkedIn, industry associations, conference attendee lists.

**Pitch:**

- Free listing + early adopter Pro free period
- "We handle your post-session notes + follow-ups"
- "Get found by clients actively searching"

### Advisor Acquisition Offers

| Offer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 60–90 day Pro trial | Remove friction |
| Founding member badge | Social proof / exclusivity |
| Priority search placement | Organic boost for verified profiles |

### Referral Loop

- "Invite a colleague" → both get extended trial
- Works well in tight-knit advisor communities

---

## Phase 3 — Generate Demand (Week 4–10)

### SEO Structure (Long-term growth engine)

Build category + location landing pages:

```
/australia/nsw/sydney/buyers-agents
/australia/vic/melbourne/mortgage-brokers
/australia/qld/brisbane/financial-advisers
```

Each page:
- H1: "Find a [Category] in [Location]"
- Filters + top results
- FAQ section (schema markup)
- Internal links to advisor profiles

### Consumer Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Client Brief Builder | "Prepare for your meeting" (no advice) |
| Save advisors + reminders | Return visits |
| "Request intro" flow | Low-friction lead creation |

### Paid Acquisition (Later)

- Google Ads on high-intent keywords: "financial adviser sydney"
- Retargeting visitors who didn't submit a lead

---

## Phase 4 — Liquidity Loops (Ongoing)

### Time-to-First-Response is Your Early Liquidity KPI

- Track median response time by advisor
- Create a "Fast responders" boost in ranking
- Surface "Usually responds within X hours" on profiles

### Enforce Lead SLA for Pro/Team

- If response time degrades, ranking boost decays
- Nudge advisors: "You have 3 leads waiting"

### Supply-Demand Matching

- If leads in a category/location exceed supply → prioritize seeding there
- If advisors in a category have low lead volume → reduce acquisition there
