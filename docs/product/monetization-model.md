# Monetization Model (AU Marketplace + Copilot)

## Principles

- Consumers remain free (reduces friction, improves lead volume).
- Monetize advisors via subscription + tooling (sticky, predictable revenue).
- Keep incentives aligned: avoid pay-per-lead incentives that can degrade quality unless tightly controlled.
- Transparency: any paid placement must be labeled "Sponsored" to preserve trust.

## Revenue Lines (priority order)

### 1) Advisor Subscription (Primary)

Freemium marketplace listing + paid dashboard features.

#### Tier A — Free Listing

- Public profile + basic search presence
- Receive leads (limited volume or limited tools)
- Basic messaging
- Claim & basic verification

#### Tier B — Pro (Solo)

- Full lead pipeline + templates
- Copilot v1 (post-session): summary, action items, follow-up drafts, brief updates, compliance wording flags
- Document uploads + structured client brief
- "Verified" badge eligibility (licence verification required where applicable)
- Basic analytics: response time, acceptance rate, conversion

#### Tier C — Team (Practice)

- Multiple seats per business
- Lead assignment + SLAs
- Shared templates library
- Practice-level analytics
- Higher Copilot usage limits

#### Tier D — Enterprise

- SSO, audit exports, data retention controls
- Custom workflows and template packs
- Priority support

#### Pricing Shape (AUD, indicative ranges)

| Tier | Price |
|------|-------|
| Free | $0 |
| Pro | $49–$199 / month per advisor (usage caps) |
| Team | $299–$999 / month per business (seat-based) |
| Enterprise | Custom |

### 2) Sponsored/Featured Listings (Secondary)

- "Featured" placement in search results within a category/location.
- Must be clearly labeled.
- Ranking: sponsored slots are separate from organic ranking, with caps (e.g., max 2 per page) to maintain trust.

---

### 3) Copilot Usage Add-ons (Secondary)

- Bundle a monthly included usage amount.
- Sell add-on credits for high-volume practices.
- Rationale: avoids charging consumers; keeps value capture tied to usage.

---

### 4) Bookings / Payments (Optional later)

- If you add payments (for paid consults), take a small platform fee.
- Keep optional to avoid regulatory complexity at launch.

## Monetization-Driven Product Priorities

Pro tier must deliver a **weekly felt win**:

- Post-session autopilot notes + follow-up drafts
- Client brief updating
- Compliance wording review

Marketplace must provide **baseline value even on Free**:

- Claiming + profile + inbound leads

---

## Guardrails

- Never monetize by selling "advice" or client decisions.
- Never present AI outputs to consumers as recommendations.

## Competitive Context (AU)

| Competitor | Model | Advyser Differentiation |
|------------|-------|-------------------------|
| Adviser Ratings | Lead gen / sponsorship | Copilot = advisor retention moat |
| Finder | Affiliate / referral | Direct advisor relationship |
| OpenAgent | Commission on sale | No transaction cut; subscription |

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Free → Pro conversion rate | Core funnel health |
| Pro churn (monthly) | Stickiness of Copilot |
| Copilot usage / week | Engagement proxy |
| Lead → response rate by tier | Quality signal |
| Sponsored slot CTR | Advertising yield |
