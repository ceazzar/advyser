Below is a **Copilot v1 spec** you can hand to yourself/engineers and start building. It’s **supply-side first**, **AU-safe by design**, and designed to slot neatly into your marketplace + advisor dashboard.

---

## Copilot v1 goal

Make advisors **faster and more consistent** at:

* turning a meeting into **file notes**
* producing **action items**
* drafting **follow-ups**
* keeping a living **client brief**
  …without the AI ever giving advice to the client.

**V1 mantra:** *“Drafts for the advisor. Advisor decides.”*

---

## Scope for V1 (what ships)

### V1.0 (strong MVP)

**Post-session Copilot** only (no live listening yet):

* Upload transcript / paste notes / upload docs
* Generate:

  1. **Meeting Summary**
  2. **Action Items**
  3. **Follow-up email draft**
  4. **Updated Client Brief** (structured fields)
  5. **Compliance wording flags** (non-legal, “review these phrases”)

### Explicitly NOT in V1

* Client-facing chat that answers “what should I do?”
* Product/suburb recommendations
* Automated sending (advisor must click + edit)
* Cross-advisor “advice graph”

---

## Inputs (what Copilot accepts)

### Primary inputs (must have at least one)

1. **Transcript text** (paste or upload .txt/.docx)
2. **Meeting notes** (free text)
3. **Audio file** (optional in v1.1 if you add transcription)
4. **Documents**: PDF/DOCX (SOA drafts, fact find, loan docs, property brief)
5. **Email thread paste** (or .eml later)

### Context inputs (optional but powerful)

* Lead / client metadata:

  * advisor type (financial / mortgage / buyer’s agent / property)
  * meeting type (discovery, review, strategy, pre-approval, etc.)
  * meeting date/time
  * preferred tone (formal / friendly)
* Templates:

  * “My file note format”
  * “My follow-up email format”
* “Do not include” list (sensitive fields you don’t want in drafts)

---

## Outputs (what Copilot produces)

All outputs are **advisor-only drafts** stored in the client workspace.

### 1) Meeting Summary (structured + readable)

* Purpose of meeting
* Key topics discussed
* Client goals (as stated)
* Constraints / risks mentioned
* Decisions made (if any)
* Open questions / missing info

### 2) Action Items (split by who)

* Advisor tasks (e.g., “send checklist”, “request documents”)
* Client tasks (e.g., “provide payslips”, “confirm budget range”)
* Due dates (if stated; otherwise blank)

### 3) Follow-up draft (email/message)

* Recap + next steps
* Document request list
* Booking prompt (optional)
* Tone controlled by advisor setting

### 4) Updated Client Brief (your “living memory”)

A structured object that the advisor can edit:

* Goals
* Situation summary
* Financial/property snapshot (only what was mentioned)
* Preferences (online/in-person, timeline, risk tolerance *if stated*)
* Outstanding info required
* Next appointment objective

### 5) Compliance wording flags (non-legal)

* “Phrases that may sound like a recommendation/opinion”
* “Missing disclosures” checklist (customizable per advisor type)
* “Ambiguities / assumptions detected”

**Important:** This is framed as “review” and “check,” not “compliance advice.”

## UX in the Advisor Dashboard (screens + flow)

### Where it lives

In **Lead Detail / Client Workspace** as a tab:

**Tabs:** Overview | Messages | Documents | Notes | **Copilot** | Tasks

### Copilot tab layout (simple, high conversion)

**Top section: “Create a Copilot Run”**

* Upload / paste inputs
* Select meeting type
* Select output pack (checkboxes)
* Run button

**Middle: “Draft Outputs” (side-by-side editor)**

* Meeting Summary (editable)
* Action Items (editable)
* Follow-up (editable)
* Client Brief (editable)
* Flags (read-only + “mark reviewed”)

**Actions (always explicit human control)**

* Save to Notes
* Create Tasks from Action Items
* Copy to clipboard
* Export PDF (optional)
* “Send follow-up” only as *draft inserted into message composer* (advisor clicks send)

**Bottom: “History”**

* Past Copilot runs (with timestamps)
* Diff view (what changed in client brief)

### Advisor delight features (v1 must-haves)

* “Make this shorter / more formal / bullet points”
* “Regenerate just this section”
* “Use my template next time” (save template)

---

## Guardrails (AU-safe by design)

### 1) Audience separation (hard rule)

* **Copilot outputs are never shown to consumers** unless the advisor manually copies/sends them.

### 2) Recommendation suppression

Copilot must avoid:

* “You should invest in…”
* “The best option is…”
* “Buy in suburb X…”
* Specific product/provider/suburb calls

Instead it can say:

* “Topics to discuss / questions to clarify”
* “Options the client mentioned” (attribution-based)
* “Information required to assess options” (process support)

### 3) Advisor approval + auditability

Every generated output is:

* labeled **DRAFT**
* editable
* saved with:

  * who generated it
  * when
  * which inputs were used
  * model version

### 4) Refusal and redirect behavior

If input contains “recommend X” prompts, Copilot responds with:

* “I can help draft a summary, questions to ask, or a follow-up. I can’t generate client-specific recommendations.”

### 5) Sensitive data handling

* Default redaction on common sensitive identifiers (TFN, passport, Medicare, bank numbers) if detected
* Advisor can opt out for internal notes, but default should be safe

---

## Storage model (minimal but future-proof)

### Core tables

**CopilotRun**

* `id`
* `business_id`
* `advisor_user_id`
* `client_record_id` (or lead_id)
* `created_at`
* `input_refs[]`
* `settings_json` (tone, template, meeting_type)
* `model_id`, `prompt_version`
* `status` (success/failure)

**CopilotInputArtifact**

* `id`
* `copilot_run_id`
* `type` (transcript, notes, doc)
* `storage_uri`
* `text_extracted` (optional)
* `hash` (dedupe)
* `created_at`

**CopilotOutput**

* `id`
* `copilot_run_id`
* `type` (summary, actions, followup, brief, flags)
* `content` (markdown/json)
* `edited_content` (if advisor modifies)
* `finalized_at` (when saved to Notes/Tasks)
* `approved_by_user_id`

**AdvisorNote** (your existing “notes” system)

* `id`
* `client_record_id`
* `note_type`
* `content`
* `source` = `manual | copilot`
* `source_ref_id` (copilot_output_id)

**Task**

* `id`
* `client_record_id`
* `owner_user_id`
* `description`
* `due_date`
* `source_ref_id`

### Search hooks (optional in v1, but easy win)

* Store embeddings for **AdvisorNote** + **Client Brief** later for “recall my past cases”
* Keep this disabled until you need it

---

## Suggested Copilot “Output Pack” presets (one-click)

* **Discovery Call Pack**: summary + action items + follow-up + brief
* **Review Pack**: summary + open questions + brief update
* **Docs Pack**: document summary + missing info checklist + follow-up request
* **Compliance Pack**: flags + rewritten “safer wording” suggestions (still drafts)

---

## Implementation pipeline (cloud-code friendly)

1. Ingest → virus scan → store artifact
2. Extract text (pdf/docx) → normalize
3. Redact sensitive tokens (default)
4. Build context object (client metadata + template)
5. LLM generate outputs (separately per output type for controllability)
6. Post-check:

   * recommendation language detector
   * forbidden entity detector (products/suburbs if you want)
7. Save outputs + audit
8. Render editor UI

---

## What “done” looks like for V1 (success metrics)

* % of meetings where Copilot run is created
* Avg time from meeting → file note saved
* Follow-up drafts generated → sent (advisor initiated)
* Advisor satisfaction (“this saved me time”)
* Flag review rate (shows trust/compliance value)
