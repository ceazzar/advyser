Cool — this is a **trust + regulatory safety** cornerstone. Done right, it also becomes a ranking moat (“verified + legit + responsive”).

Below is a **build-ready claim + verification system** for **financial + property advisors in Australia**, with **manual-first** (fast MVP) and clear upgrade paths to automation.

---

## 1) The objects you need (so the workflow stays sane)

### Business (real-world entity)

* `business_id`, `trading_name`, `legal_name`, `abn`, `acn` (optional)
* `addresses[]`, `phone`, `website`
* `claimed_status`: `unclaimed | pending | claimed`
* `verification_level`: `none | basic | licence_verified | enhanced`

### ClaimRequest

* `claim_request_id`, `business_id`, `requester_user_id`
* `submitted_fields` (ABN, licence numbers, etc.)
* `evidence_files[]`
* `status`: `pending | needs_more_info | approved | denied`
* `review_notes`, `reviewed_by`, timestamps

### Credentials (multi-regime)

A single, flexible table:

* `credential_type`:

  * **Financial advice**: FAR (relevant provider), AFS licence, Authorised Representative
  * **Credit/mortgage**: Australian Credit Licence (ACL), Credit Representative
  * **Property**: state real estate / land agent / buyer’s agent licence/registration
* `credential_number`, `name_on_register`, `state`, `expiry` (if applicable)
* `verification_status`: `unverified | pending | verified | rejected`
* `verification_source`: `asic_register | state_register | document_only`
* `verified_at`, `verified_by`

---

## 2) Verification levels (simple, explainable, rankable)

### Level 0 — Unverified

* Listing exists (maybe imported/seeded), but no proof

### Level 1 — Basic Verified (fast + strong fraud reduction)

Requirements:

* Email + phone verified
* ABN verified (business exists + matches name) via ABN Lookup / ABR data ([ABN Lookup][1])
* Proof of control of business contact method:

  * OTP to listed business phone **or**
  * DNS / email domain verification **or**
  * “Add a code to your website footer” (like GSC-style)

### Level 2 — Licence Verified (the money badge)

Requirements depend on advisor type, using **public registers**:

**Financial advisers**

* Match adviser on ASIC-managed Financial Advisers Register (published on MoneySmart) ([ASIC][2])

**AFS authorised reps / licensees**

* Match on ASIC Professional Registers / AR Register ([ASIC][3])

**Mortgage / credit**

* Confirm covered by an Australian credit licence / credit activity coverage (ASIC credit licence context) ([ASIC][4])
  (Implementation-wise you’re verifying the licence/rep record exists on ASIC registers via PRS search.) ([ASIC][3])

**Property / buyer’s agent / real estate**
Verify using the appropriate state public register:

* NSW: Verify NSW / Service NSW licence check ([Service NSW][5])
* VIC: Estate agents public register ([Consumer Affairs Victoria][6])
* QLD: “Check a property licence” register ([Queensland Government][7])
* WA: Consumer Protection licence and registration search ([consumerprotection.wa.gov.au][8])
* SA: CBS / land agent info + licence holder search entry point ([SA Government][9])

### Level 3 — Enhanced (optional later)

* Identity verification (KYC) for the claimant (not always needed)
* Extra checks for high-risk categories
* Ongoing monitoring / re-verification cadence

---

## 3) The Claim flow (MVP: manual-first, minimal friction)

### Step 1 — Claim entry point

From a listing page: **“Claim this business”**

User picks:

* “I’m the owner/principal”
* “I work here (staff)”

### Step 2 — Provide claim data (guided by advisor type)

Ask only what’s relevant:

**Everyone**

* ABN (or ACN)
* Role/title
* Business email + phone
* Service areas

**Financial advice track**

* Adviser name + FAR link or identifier (they can paste)
* AFS licence number (if licensee) or AR details (if rep)

**Mortgage/credit track**

* ACL number or credit rep details (if available)

**Property track**

* State + licence/registration number

### Step 3 — Proof of control (anti-fraud gate)

Choose one:

1. OTP to business phone listed on the profile/ABN record
2. Verify email domain (e.g., *@business.com.au*)
3. Website verification code

### Step 4 — Evidence upload (only when needed)

* Screenshot/PDF of licence card / certificate
* Letter of authority (if staff claiming)
* Optional: ASIC/MoneySmart profile link(s)

### Step 5 — Status = Pending

Admin review queue created automatically.

---

## 4) Admin review workflow (fast + consistent)

### Admin screen shows (side-by-side)

* Claimant user identity + verification (email/phone)
* Submitted ABN and ABR match result (name/address) ([ABN Lookup][1])
* Licence checks:

  * ASIC PRS search results (manual link-out initially) ([ASIC][3])
  * MoneySmart FAR listing for advisers ([Moneysmart][10])
  * State licence register link-outs for property ([Queensland Government][7])
* Evidence files

### Admin decisions

* **Approve** → business becomes claimed, requester assigned as `owner`
* **Needs more info** → request specific missing field / proof
* **Deny** → record reason + lockout rule if malicious

---

## 5) Automation upgrades (without getting stuck on “no API”)

### What you *can* automate early (high ROI)

**ABN verification via ABR web services** (real API, designed for devs) ([ABN Lookup][11])
Use it to:

* validate ABN status
* fetch entity name + address
* match to listing fields (fuzzy)

### What is typically “semi-automated”

**ASIC Professional Registers Search** is publicly searchable and supports searching by name/number/ABN. In MVP, keep it manual (link-out + admin checkbox). ([ASIC][3])
Later you can:

* use a third-party aggregation provider if you choose (optional)
* or build a structured internal verification process where staff verifies and stores “verified_at + source”

### State property licence checks

These vary by state. Most are web search tools; treat as **manual verification** at first, but store:

* `source_url` used
* `verified_at`
* `licence_status` from register

---

## 6) Anti-fraud measures (practical, marketplace-grade)

### A) Claim fraud prevention

* **One business = one owner** (initially). Staff must be invited by owner later.
* Require proof-of-control step before admin even reviews.
* Rate-limit claim attempts per user/IP/device fingerprint
* Block disposable email domains for claimants

### B) Impersonation detection

* Flag if claimant email domain ≠ business domain and no phone/website proof
* Flag if ABN entity name mismatch is high
* Flag if claimant tries to claim multiple unrelated businesses quickly

### C) Review fraud prevention (huge)

* Only allow reviews linked to a **Lead/Booking** record in your system (“verified engagement”)
* Delay review eligibility until lead status = `completed` or `converted`
* Abuse monitoring: many reviews from same IP/device, unusual timing bursts

### D) Ongoing monitoring (later, but plan now)

* Re-check “verified” credentials on a schedule
* Auto-expire verification if licence is suspended/expired (where registers expose that status)
* “Report this advisor” workflow → fast admin queue

---

## 7) How verification impacts ranking (simple rules)

* Unverified listings can appear, but get a **ranking penalty**
* “Verified” badge is a meaningful conversion lever
* Tie-breakers:

  1. Licence Verified
  2. Fast response time
  3. Higher profile completeness
  4. Verified reviews

This incentivizes good behaviour.

## 8) What I’d ship first (MVP spec you can build immediately)

**Week-1 version:**

* Claim flow + proof-of-control (phone OTP OR website code)
* Admin approve/deny
* ABN verification via ABR API
* Licence verification = admin checklist + stored evidence + source link

**Week-2/3 improvements:**

* Add per-state property licence link shortcuts (NSW/VIC/QLD/WA/SA)
* Add ASIC PRS + FAR link shortcuts inside admin view
* Add “verification level” badge logic + ranking boost
