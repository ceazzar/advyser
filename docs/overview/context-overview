## The product in one sentence

**Advyser is a two-sided marketplace for finding and engaging advisors, plus an advisor operating system that upgrades how advisors run sessions and manage clients—using AI as internal decision-support, not client-facing advice.**


I’ll keep this practical: **flows → components → roadmap → where AI goes**.

---

## Non-negotiable AU guardrails (so you don’t trip AFSL)

**Consumer-facing AI must not provide financial product advice** (recommendations/opinions intended to influence decisions), and “personal advice” is especially sensitive. The Corporations Act definition is explicit about “recommendation or opinion intended to influence” decisions. ([AustLII][1])
ASIC also distinguishes **personal vs general advice** and ties obligations to it. ([ASIC][2])

So your platform posture is:

* **Marketplace = directory + lead routing + booking + messaging**
* **Demand-side AI (light) = intake, clarification, education, question-building**
* **Supply-side AI (heavy) = advisor workflow support (notes, tasks, compliance wording checks, doc summarisation, memory)**

This keeps the “advice” act firmly on the advisor.

# 1) The end-to-end product, from both sides

## A) Consumer journey (marketplace basics)

1. **Home**

   * “Find a financial advisor / mortgage broker / buyer’s agent / property strategist” (your categories)
   * Location-first (state/suburb/postcode)
   * Clear disclaimers: “We connect you to advisors; information is general.”

2. **Search & filters**

   * Location radius + state
   * Specialty: retirement, SMSF, debt, first home, portfolio lending, buyer’s agent, etc.
   * Service type: one-off consult / ongoing / project-based
   * Meeting mode: online / in-person
   * Price range / fee model (hourly / fixed / % / retainer)
   * Languages, availability, “works with” (first-home buyers, HNW, investors)

3. **Advisor profile**

   * Services & pricing
   * Credentials (AFSL / rep #, credit licence if relevant, real estate licence if relevant)
   * “What I help with” + “Who I don’t work with”
   * Proof: reviews, case-style summaries (careful: no implied outcomes), FAQs
   * CTA: **Request intro / Book / Message**

4. **Signup (optional for browsing; required for contacting)**

   * Email/phone verification
   * Intake consent + privacy

5. **Lead creation**

   * Simple form + optional AI intake assistant (light, safe)
   * Outputs a **Client Brief** sent to advisor (not advice back to user)

6. **Booking + messaging**

   * Calendar integration (later)
   * In-platform messaging + attachments

7. **Post-session**

   * User can rate the experience (not “investment performance”)
   * Follow-up reminders (non-advice)

### Demand-side AI (light, safe)

* “Help me explain my situation”
* “What questions should I ask a financial advisor/buyer’s agent?”
* “Summarise what I’m trying to achieve”
* “Turn my notes into a brief”

**Never:** “What should I invest in / which suburb should I buy in / what’s best?”
If asked, AI redirects to: “Here are questions to ask your advisor.”

---

## B) Advisor journey (claim → listing → dashboard)

1. **Discover / claim**

   * Advisor searches their business name
   * “Claim this profile”
   * Verification options:

     * Email domain match
     * Phone OTP to listed number
     * Upload evidence (licence/registration docs)
     * Manual review fallback

2. **Advisor onboarding**

   * Profile completion wizard
   * Pick categories + services
   * Set availability + lead preferences
   * Connect calendar (optional)
   * Choose plan (free listing vs paid)

3. **Advisor dashboard (MVP)**

   * Leads inbox
   * Messaging
   * Bookings
   * Client list (basic CRM-lite)
   * Notes & file storage (per client)
   * Profile & settings

4. **Advyser Copilot (where you go hard)**

   * Starts as **post-session** support (lowest friction, safest)
   * Expands into **workflow intelligence**
   * Eventually into **live session companion** (optional)

---

## C) Admin journey (you’ll need this early)

* Approve/deny claims
* Handle disputes (“this is my business”)
* Moderate reviews
* Fraud prevention (fake advisors)
* Content moderation (profiles, messages)
* Audit logs

---

# 2) Core components you need (marketplace first)

## Public website

* Home, search, category pages, advisor profiles
* SEO structure (suburb + category pages become growth engine)

## Marketplace backend

* Listings database
* Search index + ranking (location + relevance + quality signals)
* Lead routing (requests, bookings)
* Messaging service
* Reviews & moderation

## Identity & verification

* Role-based auth: consumer / advisor / staff
* Claim verification pipeline
* “Verified” badges (only when checks pass)

## Advisor dashboard

* Profile editor
* Lead pipeline (New → Contacted → Booked → Converted → Archived)
* Basic client records
* Document upload per client
* Settings + subscription/billing

---

# 3) Where the advanced capabilities fit (Copilot map)

### Copilot Phase 1: Post-session autopilot (high value, low risk)

**Inputs:** meeting notes, transcript upload, emails, docs
**Outputs (advisor-only):**

* Structured file note
* Action items + follow-up email draft (advisor sends)
* “Open questions” list for next session
* Compliance wording flags (e.g., statements that sound like recommendations)

### Copilot Phase 2: Client workspace intelligence

* Ongoing “client brief” that stays updated
* Timeline of interactions
* “What changed since last time?”
* “What’s pending?”

### Copilot Phase 3: Live session companion (opt-in)

* Real-time topic capture
* Prompts: “You haven’t confirmed X constraint yet”
* No recommendations—only prompts + recall + documentation assist

### Copilot Phase 4: Practice-level intelligence (moat)

* “What questions do my best clients ask?”
* “Which services convert best?”
* “Where do leads drop off?”
* Template library (advisor’s own templates)

---

# 4) AU-specific: Financial + property advisor types (how to model it)

You’ll likely support multiple “advisor archetypes” with different compliance needs:

* **Financial advisers / planners** (AFSL ecosystem)
* **Mortgage brokers / credit advisers** (credit licensing regime—separate)
* **Buyer’s agents** (state-based real estate licensing; varies by state) ([REBAA][3])
* **Property professionals** (careful wording: “property investment advice” can drift into regulated territory depending on what’s said)

Product implication:
**Build your advisor schema to be multi-regime:**

* advisor_type
* licence_type(s)
* licence_number(s)
* state(s) serviced
* verification_status per licence

And keep your copy neutral:

* “Connect with a professional”
* “Get help understanding options”
* “Prepare for your appointment”

# 5) MVP roadmap (what you build first, in order)

## Phase 0 — Foundations (week 1–2 equivalent scope)

* Auth + roles
* Advisor listing model
* Claim flow (manual review is fine initially)
* Admin console (minimum viable)

## Phase 1 — Marketplace MVP

* Home + search + profile pages
* Contact request / lead form
* Basic messaging
* Advisor dashboard: leads inbox + profile editor

## Phase 2 — Trust layer

* Verification badges
* Reviews (post-engagement only)
* Reporting & moderation

## Phase 3 — Copilot v1 (supply-side “wow”)

* Upload transcript/notes → generate:

  * structured notes
  * action plan
  * follow-up draft
* Store outputs in client workspace
* Advisor controls + audit trail

## Phase 4 — Copilot v2 (workflow)

* Template library
* “Next session prep”
* Document summarisation (SOA inputs, checklists—advisor-owned)

## Phase 5 — Light demand-side AI

* Intake assistant → generates “Client Brief”
* Strict guardrails + refusal patterns

---

# 6) The “clear line” that protects you (implementation detail)

**Two separate AI modes:**

### Consumer AI mode (restricted)

* Only question generation, education, summarisation of user text
* Hard blocks on “recommendation / opinion intended to influence decisions” language ([AustLII][1])

### Advisor AI mode (expanded but internal)

* Drafting, summarising, checking, recalling
* Still avoid “you should recommend X product/suburb”
* Always framed as: “consider asking / consider reviewing / draft for your approval”

---

# 7) What we should dive into next (pick one)

1. **Marketplace data model + screens** (exact pages + DB objects)
2. **Search & ranking** (filters + relevance + quality + availability ranking)
3. **Advisor claim + verification** (AU licences, manual/auto checks, anti-fraud)
4. **Copilot v1 spec** (inputs/outputs, UX in dashboard, guardrails, storage)
