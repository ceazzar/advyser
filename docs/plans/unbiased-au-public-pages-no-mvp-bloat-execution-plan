# ADVYSER PLAN
# Unbiased-Inspired AU Public Pages Plan (No-MVP-Bloat)

## 1) Document Control
- Date: 2026-02-25
- Status: Draft - execution-ready after in-flight plan completion
- Owner: Product/Frontend
- Workspace: `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser`
- Scope level: MVP-safe public pages only

## 2) Purpose
Adopt high-leverage UX/content patterns inspired by Unbiased for Advyser public pages, adapted to Australian compliance context, without introducing platform bloat.

This plan is intentionally constrained and should improve clarity, trust, and conversion continuity while keeping implementation lightweight.

## 3) Execution Gate
This plan starts only after the currently in-flight public-page plan is completed and stabilized.

Gate criteria:
1. In-flight changes merged to working branch.
2. Shared-file conflicts resolved first (header/footer/layout/config).
3. Baseline checks green before new edits (`lint`, `test:run`, `build`).

## 4) No-Bloat Rules (Hard Constraints)
1. Do not add new route families.
2. Do not add CMS migration.
3. Do not add live chat.
4. Do not add deep marketing automation.
5. Do not add enterprise support tooling.
6. Use existing layout and component system where possible.
7. Any new backend endpoint must be minimal and optional-gated.

## 5) What We Borrow from Unbiased (Lean Version)
1. Clear trust framing and process transparency.
2. Contact path segmentation by audience.
3. Practical help content with escalation path.
4. Legal pages with visible metadata (last updated/version/owner).
5. Cookie policy that matches actual implementation behavior.

## 6) AU Adaptation Rules
1. Replace UK/FCA terms with AU context:
   - ASIC
   - AFCA
   - OAIC
2. Align wording with Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and APP-style language.
3. Use config-driven AU business identity:
   - legal entity
   - ABN
   - support/legal/privacy contacts
4. Use timezone wording: "Sydney time (AEST/AEDT)".
5. Keep "platform is free to use" separate from "advice services may be paid".

## 7) In-Scope Routes
Primary scope in this document:
1. `/about`
2. `/contact`
3. `/help`
4. `/privacy`
5. `/terms`
6. `/cookies`
7. `/disclaimer`

Out of scope:
1. Auth portal rebuild
2. Dashboard/advisor/admin routes
3. Search map mode
4. Compare route
5. Full content-engine architecture

## 8) Overlap and Conflict Controls
This plan has partial overlap with parallel public-page work through shared files and shared copy/trust messaging.

### 8.1 Shared files with elevated conflict risk
1. `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/lib/public-business.ts`
2. `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/components/layout/public-header.tsx`
3. `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/components/layout/public-footer.tsx`
4. `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/app/layout.tsx`
5. `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/app/sitemap.ts`
6. `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/components/composite/cookie-consent.tsx`

### 8.2 Conflict mitigation sequence
1. Lock shared-file ownership during implementation window.
2. Merge and stabilize in-flight plan first.
3. Apply this plan in route-grouped commits.
4. Run baseline regression after each route group.
5. Delay optional API additions until route copy and static content are complete.

### 8.3 Merge discipline
1. One route group per commit where practical.
2. Do not mix legal copy edits with unrelated UI refactors.
3. Keep config/schema changes isolated and explicit.

## 9) Route-by-Route Plan

## 9.1 `/about`
### Goals
1. Improve trust clarity above fold.
2. Remove weak or unverifiable claims.
3. Keep page lean and conversion-supportive.

2. Contact references are config-driven only.
3. Verification responsibility boundaries are explicit.

## 10) Cross-Page UX and Content Standards
1. Common legal-page header template:
   - title
   - last updated
   - version
   - owner
   - optional in-page anchors
2. Scanability:
   - short paragraphs
   - clear headings
   - bounded tables/lists for policy-heavy sections
3. Consistent CTA verb set:
   - "Contact support"
   - "Get help"
   - "Report an issue"
4. Tone:
   - plain English first
   - legal precision retained in full body text
5. Metadata:
   - route-specific page metadata (title/description/OG)

## 11) API and Data Contract Changes (Optional-Gated)
Default implementation path avoids new APIs unless needed.

### 11.1 Optional endpoint
- `POST /api/support/contact`
- Payload:
  - `topic` (required)
  - `email` (required)
  - `message` (required)
  - `name` (optional)
  - `consent` (required boolean)

### 11.2 Gate criteria to proceed with endpoint
1. Route copy + static pathways complete.
2. Validation and abuse controls designed:
   - schema validation
   - origin checks
   - rate limiting
3. Error model defined for user-safe messages.
4. Owner assigned for inbox handling.

If gate not met, keep segmented mailto/contact actions and defer endpoint.

## 12) Config and Type Additions
File: `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/lib/public-business.ts`

Proposed additions:
1. `mediaEmail?: string`
2. `complaintsEmail?: string`
3. `legalAddress?: string`
4. `supportHours?: string`

Policy metadata:
1. Add shared policy metadata constants module, for example:
   - `/Users/ceazar/Code Base/advyser/site/src/lib/constants/policy-meta.ts`
2. Shape:
   - `lastUpdated`
   - `version`
   - `owner`

Rendering rule:
1. Missing values are hidden gracefully.
2. Never display placeholder legal/contact values.

## 13) Delivery Phases and Commit Strategy

## 14) Test Plan

## 14.1 Functional checks
1. Route load checks for all seven routes.
2. Link integrity checks:
   - no dead links
   - no pruned-route references
3. Config fallback behavior:
   - missing optional values do not render placeholders

## 14.2 Content and consistency checks
1. No hardcoded legal/support contact strings in page files.
2. Consistent AU references (ASIC/AFCA/OAIC context).
3. Consistent timestamp/version metadata across legal pages.

## 14.3 Cookie parity checks
1. Policy references actual consent storage behavior.
2. Banner text and policy instructions match.
3. No unimplemented vendor claim remains.

## 14.4 Accessibility checks
1. Heading hierarchy correctness.
2. Keyboard navigation and focus visibility.
3. Link text clarity.
4. Mobile readability for long legal content blocks.

## 14.5 SEO checks
1. Unique metadata per route.
2. Updated sitemap consistency where needed.

## 14.6 Optional API checks (if endpoint implemented)
1. Request validation error handling.
2. Rate-limit behavior.
3. Safe user-facing error messages.
4. Success path and observable handling contract.

## 15) Definition of Done
1. All seven routes updated per scope.
2. No placeholders/hardcoded legal contacts in rendered pages.
3. Legal metadata visible and consistent.
4. Cookie policy reconciled with runtime.
5. Help and contact have practical escalation clarity.
6. No scope creep into out-of-scope systems.
7. Baseline checks pass:
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run test:run`
   - `npm run build`

## 16) Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Shared-file merge churn
Mitigation:
1. Sequence after in-flight plan.
2. Shared-file owner and commit isolation.

### Risk 2: Legal copy drift across pages
Mitigation:
1. Central wording checklist.
2. One pass for legal consistency review before release.

### Risk 3: Optional API bloat
Mitigation:
1. Gate endpoint behind strict readiness criteria.
2. Default to no-endpoint path for MVP.

### Risk 4: Missing config values in non-prod env
Mitigation:
1. Hide optional fields gracefully.
2. Keep env checks aligned with required vs optional keys.

## 17) Explicit Assumptions
1. Strict MVP remains the governing principle.
2. Routes and layout architecture remain unchanged.
3. Legal final wording requires legal/compliance sign-off.
4. AU context references are informational and must be validated for final legal text.
5. This plan executes after current in-flight plan completion.

## 18) Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Confirm in-flight plan merge complete
- [ ] Run baseline checks before editing
- [ ] Apply Phase 0 shared standards
- [ ] Implement Contact and Help route updates
- [ ] Implement Privacy/Terms/Cookies/Disclaimer updates
- [ ] Implement About trust refresh
- [ ] Decide go/no-go for optional support endpoint
- [ ] Run full regression checks
- [ ] Prepare legal sign-off package

## 19) End State
Advyser public support/legal pages become clearer, more trustworthy, AU-adapted, and operationally consistent, while preserving strict MVP boundaries and avoiding product bloat.
