Nice — let’s make this **build-ready**: pages/screens first, then the **minimum data model** that supports them (marketplace MVP), plus the key “future hooks” so Copilot slots in cleanly later.

## 1) Screens and flows (MVP)

### Public (no login required)

**1. Home**

* Primary CTA: *Find an advisor*
* Category tiles: Financial Advice, Mortgage Broker, Buyer’s Agent, Property Advisory (you can refine taxonomy later)
* Location input (postcode/suburb/state)
* Trust strip: “Verified advisors”, “Reviews”, “Secure messaging”
* Compliance footer: “We connect you with advisors. No advice provided on this site.”

**2. Search results**

* Filters (left rail / modal on mobile):

  * Location radius
  * Advisor type (financial / mortgage / buyer’s agent / property)
  * Specialty tags
  * Meeting mode (online/in-person)
  * Price / fee model
  * Availability (has openings this week)
  * Verified only
* Results cards:

  * Name, business, type, location
  * Top specialties
  * “Verified” badge
  * Price indicator
  * CTA: View profile / Request intro

**3. Advisor profile (listing page)**

* Overview: who they help, services, typical clients
* Credentials (licence / registration fields + verification status)
* Service offerings + pricing
* Reviews (only from verified engagements)
* CTA: Request intro / Book (if enabled) / Message (if enabled)

**4. Request intro (lead form)**

* Structured intake (no advice):

  * What are you trying to achieve?
  * Timeline
  * Location
  * Budget range (optional)
  * Preferred meeting mode
  * Upload docs (optional)
* Consent checkbox + privacy
* Output: creates a **Lead**

**5. Sign up / login**

* Required when submitting a lead (optional to browse)

---

### Consumer (logged in)

**6. Consumer dashboard**

* My requests/leads (status timeline)
* Messages
* Bookings (if used)
* Documents

---

### Advisor (logged in)

**7. Claim business / join**

* “Claim this listing” CTA on profile or separate page
* Verification steps (MVP can be manual review)
* Once approved → advisor gets access to dashboard + profile editor

**8. Advisor dashboard**

* Lead inbox (pipeline)
* Messages
* Bookings (optional in MVP)
* Profile editor
* Team members (optional later)
* Settings (notifications, service areas, pricing)

**9. Lead detail**

* Client brief (what they submitted)
* Notes area (internal)
* Status actions: accept / decline / request more info / mark booked / archive
* “Send message” / “Create booking”
* Attachments

---

### Admin (internal)

**10. Admin console**

* Claim requests: approve/deny
* Listings moderation
* Reviews moderation
* Fraud/report queue
* Category/tag management
* Basic analytics

---

## 2) Core objects (what you must store)

You want a model that supports:

* **Businesses** (can exist before claim)
* **Advisors** (user accounts + professional profile)
* **Listings** (public profiles shown in search)
* **Leads** (requests from consumers)
* **Messaging**
* **Verification**
* **Reviews**

Here’s the clean separation that avoids pain later:

### A) Identity

* **User**

  * `id`
  * `email`, `phone`
  * `role`: `consumer | advisor | admin`
  * `created_at`, `last_login_at`

### B) Marketplace supply (public inventory)

* **Business**

  * `id`
  * `legal_name`, `trading_name`
  * `abn` (optional, but useful)
  * `website`, `phone`
  * `primary_address_id`
  * `created_source`: `manual | import | claimed`
  * `claimed_status`: `unclaimed | pending | claimed`

* **Listing** (what search returns)

  * `id`
  * `business_id`
  * `headline`, `bio`
  * `advisor_type` (enum)
  * `service_modes`: online/in-person
  * `price_band` (optional)
  * `is_active`
  * `verification_level` (computed)
  * `rating_avg`, `review_count` (cached)
  * `search_boost` (admin override)

> Why separate Business vs Listing?
> Business is the “real-world entity.” Listing is the “marketplace presentation.” Later, teams/multiple advisors per business becomes easy.

### C) Advisor accounts (who operates the listing)

* **AdvisorProfile**

  * `id`
  * `user_id`
  * `business_id` (nullable until claim approved)
  * `display_name`
  * `position_title`
  * `bio`
  * `years_experience` (optional)
  * `languages[]`
  * `service_areas[]` (references Location or polygons later)

* **AdvisorBusinessRole**

  * `id`
  * `user_id`
  * `business_id`
  * `role`: `owner | staff`
  * `status`: `active | invited | removed`

### D) Credentials / verification (AU-safe structure)

* **Credential**

  * `id`
  * `advisor_profile_id` (or `business_id` depending on licence type)
  * `credential_type` (enum: AFSL, authorised rep, credit licence, real estate licence, etc.)
  * `credential_number`
  * `issuing_body` (text)
  * `state` (if applicable)
  * `expires_at` (optional)
  * `verification_status`: `unverified | pending | verified | rejected`
  * `verified_at`, `verified_by_admin_id`
  * `evidence_file_id` (optional)

* **ClaimRequest**

  * `id`
  * `user_id`
  * `business_id`
  * `status`: `pending | approved | denied`
  * `submitted_at`, `reviewed_at`
  * `notes_internal`

### E) Demand + transactions

* **Lead**

  * `id`
  * `consumer_user_id`
  * `business_id` (or `listing_id`)
  * `status`: `new | contacted | booked | converted | declined | closed`
  * `problem_summary` (user text)
  * `goal_tags[]` (optional)
  * `budget_range` (optional)
  * `preferred_contact_method`
  * `preferred_times` (free-text MVP)
  * `created_at`

* **LeadAssignment** (optional but good if team)

  * `lead_id`
  * `assigned_to_user_id`
  * `assigned_at`

### F) Messaging (keep it simple)

* **Conversation**

  * `id`
  * `lead_id`
  * `consumer_user_id`
  * `business_id`
  * `created_at`

* **Message**

  * `id`
  * `conversation_id`
  * `sender_user_id`
  * `body`
  * `attachments[]`
  * `created_at`
  * `read_at` (per recipient later)

### G) Booking (optional in MVP, but model now)

* **Booking**

  * `id`
  * `lead_id`
  * `starts_at`, `ends_at`
  * `mode`: online/in-person
  * `location_text` or `meeting_link`
  * `status`: `proposed | confirmed | cancelled | completed`

### H) Reviews (only post-engagement)

* **Review**

  * `id`
  * `lead_id` (ties review to a real interaction)
  * `consumer_user_id`
  * `business_id`
  * `rating` (1–5)
  * `text`
  * `status`: `pending | published | rejected`
  * `created_at`

### I) Locations (AU-focused)

* **Location**

  * `id`
  * `country` (AU)
  * `state`
  * `suburb`
  * `postcode`
  * `lat`, `lng`

You can start with suburb+postcode lookup and add geospatial later.

### J) Taxonomy (filters)

* **Specialty**

  * `id`, `name`, `advisor_type`

* **ListingSpecialty**

  * `listing_id`, `specialty_id`

* **ServiceOffering**

  * `id`, `name`, `advisor_type`

* **ListingServiceOffering**

  * `listing_id`, `service_offering_id`, `price_text`, `duration_minutes` (optional)

---

## 3) Minimal API surface (what you’ll actually build)

### Public

* `GET /search` (filters + pagination)
* `GET /listing/:id`
* `POST /lead` (creates lead + conversation)
* `POST /auth/signup`, `POST /auth/login`

### Consumer

* `GET /me/leads`
* `GET /me/conversations`
* `POST /conversations/:id/messages`

### Advisor

* `GET /advisor/leads`
* `GET /advisor/leads/:id`
* `PATCH /advisor/leads/:id` (status updates)
* `PATCH /advisor/profile`
* `POST /claim-request`

### Admin

* `GET /admin/claim-requests`
* `PATCH /admin/claim-requests/:id`
* `PATCH /admin/reviews/:id`

---

## 4) The “future hooks” for Copilot (add now, use later)

Even if Copilot ships later, add these two tables early so you don’t migrate painfully:

* **ClientRecord**

  * `id`
  * `business_id`
  * `lead_id`
  * `display_name` (or anonymised label)
  * `created_at`

* **AdvisorNote**

  * `id`
  * `client_record_id`
  * `author_user_id`
  * `note_type`: `meeting_summary | action_items | file_note | general`
  * `content` (markdown/text)
  * `created_at`

Copilot v1 will simply generate **AdvisorNote** objects from uploads/transcripts.

---

## 5) Your build order (fastest path to something real)

1. **DB + auth + roles**
2. **Listings CRUD (admin seed + advisor edit after claim)**
3. **Search + profile pages**
4. **Lead form → Lead + Conversation + first Message**
5. **Advisor dashboard: lead inbox + lead detail + messaging**
6. **Claim flow + admin approval**

At that point you have a functioning marketplace.

If you want, next I can turn this into either:

* a **Postgres schema (DDL)** you can paste into your project, *or*
* a **screen-by-screen PRD** with exact fields/components per page (what’s required vs optional).

Pick one: **DDL** or **PRD**.
