## URL evidence for IA breadth
- Sitemap includes large numbers of location/category landing pages including AU markets (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne). Source: https://www.fresha.com/sitemap
- Business navigation exposes multiple verticals (`/for-business/salon`, `/barber`, `/nails`, `/massage`, `/medspa`, etc.). Source: https://www.fresha.com/for-business
- Help center exposes operational categories used by partners (online profile, payments, sales and checkout, billing/fees, wallet, team). Source: https://www.fresha.com/help-center/get-support

## IA gaps / unknowns
- Authenticated post-login IA (full workspace nav tree) is not fully crawlable from public surfaces.
- Consumer checkout path URLs are largely session/state based and not all directly deep-linkable without initiating booking context.
