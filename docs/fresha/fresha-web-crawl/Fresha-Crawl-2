## A) EXECUTIVE MAP (1 page)

* **Discovery →** Consumers land on Fresha via marketplace search, city/service landing pages, and business profile pages; businesses publish an “online profile” to be discoverable. ([Fresha][1])
* **Booking →** Consumers pick a venue/service/time and book via the provider’s Fresha booking page (also embeddable as “Book now” links/buttons on the business’s own channels). ([Fresha][2])
* **Operations (SaaS) →** Businesses run scheduling + services + team + clients + checkout via the partner (merchant) product, supported by a deep Knowledge Base/Academy. ([partners.fresha.com][3])
* **Payments →** Fresha Payments supports online + in-person payments, a “business wallet,” payouts, terminals, Tap to Pay, self-checkout links, and payment policies (deposits/upfront payments, cancellation/no-show fees). ([Fresha][4])
* **Fees/Attribution →** A **Marketplace New Client Fee** applies when a *brand-new client* discovers a business through the **Fresha Marketplace**; it’s **one-time per new marketplace client**, calculated off the booking value; it’s **not** charged for clients sourced via direct links/website/social. ([Fresha][5])
* **Retention/Marketing →** The system supports marketing campaigns/offers and client loyalty tooling (Knowledge Base categories). ([Fresha][6])
* **Platform governance →** Terms define “Partner Profiles,” “Partner Services,” “Partner Terms of Sale,” and payment constructs (Partner Credit/Vouchers) underpinning bookings/commerce. ([terms.fresha.com][7])

**Two-sided marketplace**

* **Demand-side (Consumer marketplace):** Find nearby services, compare providers, book instantly, manage appointments; trust via ratings/reviews. ([Fresha][1])
* **Supply-side (Business SaaS):** “Fresha for professionals” partner account to manage calendar, services, team, clients, payments, marketing, reporting, billing/fees. ([partners.fresha.com][3])

**Primary monetization mechanisms discovered**

* **Marketplace New Client Fee** (one-time per marketplace-sourced new client; rate/minimum referenced on pricing page; charged via wallet). ([Fresha][5])
* **Payment processing fees / payment product attach** (Fresha Payments; rates referenced on pricing page; terminals and Tap to Pay). ([Fresha][4])
* **Subscription/plan billing** (billing area includes “Manage your Fresha plan”; canceling removes workspace access and unlists marketplace profile at period end). ([Fresha][8])
* **Messaging balance** appears as a billing surface (implies usage-based comms/SMS). ([Fresha][9])
* **Card terminal hardware** ordering (implied hardware/fintech revenue). ([Fresha][4])

## C) CORE FLOW MAPS (STEP-BY-STEP)

### C1) Consumer marketplace loop

1. **Discover / land**

   * **Page type:** Marketplace home or city/service directory
   * **Inputs:** location, service/category, time (optional)
   * **Outputs:** result list + map + featured providers
   * **Decision points:** browse vs search; deals vs standard listings ([Fresha][1])

2. **Search/browse results**

   * **Page type:** Directory landing / results list
   * **Inputs:** filters (service type, price/duration implied by snippets), map view
   * **Outputs:** set of businesses with ratings + service teasers (“See all services”) ([Fresha][1])

3. **Provider profile view**

   * **Page type:** Business profile (“Partner Profile”)
   * **Inputs:** business selected
   * **Outputs:** services menu, reviews, location, booking entry point
   * **Decision points:** choose provider; evaluate trust via rating/reviews ([terms.fresha.com][7])

4. **Pick service**

   * **Page type:** Booking page
   * **Inputs:** selected service (name, duration, price)
   * **Outputs:** availability for service/staff
   * **Decision points:** service variants, add-ons (implied by “additional services added at checkout” rule) ([Fresha][5])

5. **Choose time / staff**

   * **Page type:** Booking page
   * **Inputs:** date/time; staff (if selectable)
   * **Outputs:** selected slot locked for checkout
   * **Decision points:** slot availability; payment policy gating (deposit/upfront) ([Fresha][19])

6. **Book + confirm**

   * **Page type:** Booking confirmation / payment step (varies)
   * **Inputs:** customer details; payment method (online) or “Pay in store” construct
   * **Outputs:** appointment created; confirmation; potential 3DS step

7. **Manage booking**

   * **Page type:** Consumer account / manage appointment (concept)
   * **Inputs:** cancel/reschedule
   * **Outputs:** updated appointment status
   * **Decision points:** cancel online vs staff-cancel on behalf (affects marketplace fee application for the business) ([Fresha][5])

---

### C2) Business (merchant) ops loop

1. **Onboard business**

   * **Page type:** Partner sign-up / “For business” landing → partner account
   * **Inputs:** business identity; workspace creation
   * **Outputs:** workspace created (gated) ([Fresha][10])

2. **Set up online profile (marketplace listing)**

   * **Page type:** Online profile KB-guided setup
   * **Inputs:** venue info, services, photos, booking settings
   * **Outputs:** profile listed on marketplace; online booking enabled
   * **Decision points:** list vs unlist; import clients before going live ([Fresha][17])

3. **Add staff/team**

   * **Page type:** Team area (inferred via KB categories)
   * **Inputs:** staff members, roles, scheduling availability
   * **Outputs:** staff objects usable for booking & payments routing ([Fresha][6])

4. **Create services**

   * **Page type:** Services area (KB category)
   * **Inputs:** service name, duration, price, assignment to staff
   * **Outputs:** bookable service catalog ([Fresha][6])

5. **Set availability + calendar**

   * **Page type:** Calendar & schedule (KB category)
   * **Inputs:** opening hours, staff schedules, buffers
   * **Outputs:** available slots; calendar blocks ([Fresha][6])

6. **Manage bookings**

   * **Page type:** Calendar/appointments + group appointments (KB)
   * **Inputs:** create/edit appointments; group bookings; reschedules
   * **Outputs:** appointment states; attendance tracking
   * **Decision points:** unmanaged vs rescheduled impacts fee logic for new marketplace clients ([Fresha][5])

7. **Client CRM**

   * **Page type:** Clients area (KB category)
   * **Inputs:** client profile, contact info, referrals, loyalty
   * **Outputs:** client history; eligibility as “existing client” vs “brand-new client” for marketplace fee logic ([Fresha][23])

8. **Payments/POS**

   * **Page type:** Payments + checkout + terminals + Tap to Pay + self-checkout
   * **Inputs:** collect online/in-person; saved cards; manual entry; split payments
   * **Outputs:** transactions recorded; funds to business wallet; receipts/refunds (implied by “Sales and checkout” category) ([Fresha][4])

9. **Marketing**

   * **Page type:** Marketing category; “Blast campaign” referenced
   * **Inputs:** campaigns/offers; referral links
   * **Outputs:** client engagement + bookings ([Fresha][17])

10. **Reporting + billing**

* **Page type:** Reports & insights + Billing & fees + Wallet statements
* **Inputs:** date ranges, export/download statements
* **Outputs:** performance analytics; invoices; fee statements; wallet statement lines ([Fresha][6])

---

### C3) Money + attribution loop

1. **Choose payment rails**

   * **Who pays:** Client pays business (online or in-store)
   * **Charged by:** Payment processing fees apply when using Fresha Payments (rates referenced on pricing page)
   * **Trigger:** payment captured online/in-person; may require 3DS ([Fresha][4])

2. **Funds settlement**

   * **Who pays/receives:** Business receives proceeds into **business wallet**
   * **Where it appears:** wallet activity + downloadable statements
   * **Trigger:** each sale/transaction + associated fees ([Fresha][15])

3. **Marketplace attribution**

   * **Rule:** **Marketplace New Client Fee** applies when a client *discovers your business through the Fresha Marketplace*; not for your own website/social/direct link channels.
   * **Trigger:** booking made by a brand-new marketplace client; fee calculated from booking value (with special handling for discounts and post-booking add-ons) ([Fresha][5])

4. **Fee timing edge cases**

   * If **client cancels online** in their Fresha account → fee **does not apply immediately**; instead **deferred** to next appointment value booked.
   * If **business/staff cancels on client’s behalf** or booking is left unmanaged/rescheduled → fee can still apply. ([Fresha][5])

5. **Reporting/visibility**

   * Marketplace fee charges show in the **business wallet** and can be downloaded via statements; billing area also provides invoices/fees. ([Fresha][5])

---

## D) DATA/OBJECT MODEL (REVERSE-ENGINEERED)

**Consumer-side + marketplace objects**

* **Business (Partner)**

  * Fields: name, category, address/geo, profile photos, rating, review_count, booking_link
  * Relationships: Business has **Services**, **Staff**, **Policies**, **Reviews**, **Locations** (workspace) ([terms.fresha.com][7])
* **Service (Partner Service)**

  * Fields: name, duration, base_price, category, online_discounts (pre-defined), staff_assignment
  * Relationships: Service belongs to Business; Service can be delivered by Staff; used in Booking ([terms.fresha.com][7])
* **Staff / Team Member**

  * Fields: name, role, availability, payment-routing eligibility (multi-merchant)
  * Relationships: Staff belongs to Business; Staff can perform Services; Staff can receive routed payments ([Fresha][13])
* **Client**

  * Fields: identity/contact, source channel (marketplace vs direct), referral info, saved_cards (if enabled)
  * Relationships: Client has Bookings; Client may have loyalty/referrals ([Fresha][24])
* **Booking / Appointment**

  * Fields: datetime, duration, price_at_booking, discount_at_booking, status, channel_source, payment_requirement
  * Relationships: links Client + Business + Service(+Staff) + Payment(s)
  * States (inferred): created/confirmed, rescheduled, cancelled_by_client, cancelled_by_business, no_show (feeable), checked_out ([Fresha][5])
* **Review**

  * Fields: rating, text (optional), timestamp, booking reference
  * Constraints: hidden if business unlisted due to plan cancel; restored on reactivation ([Fresha][8])

**Payments/fintech objects**

* **Payment Policy**

  * Fields: deposit_amount_or_percent, full_upfront_flag, card_on_file_flag, cancellation_fee_rules, no_show_fee_rules
  * Relationships: attached to Business and/or specific appointments
  * Constraints: applies to group booking main payer logic; supports 3DS security ([Fresha][19])
* **Transaction (Payment)**

  * Fields: amount, method (tap_to_pay, terminal, saved_card, manual_entry, gift_card, split), status, fees
  * Relationships: belongs to Booking and Business wallet ([Fresha][4])
* **Business Wallet**

  * Fields: balance, transactions ledger, payout settings, statements
  * Relationships: aggregates transactions + fees; supports payouts ([Fresha][15])
* **Marketplace New Client Fee**

  * Fields: fee_rate (see pricing), minimum_fee (see pricing), applied_amount, deferred_flag
  * Relationships: linked to Client source + Booking value; appears in wallet ([Fresha][5])
* **Voucher / Gift Card**

  * Fields: voucher_code, value_remaining, expiry_rules, redemption_rules
  * Relationships: purchased by Client; redeemable with Partner; governed by partner terms ([terms.fresha.com][22])

---

## E) ROLE & PERMISSION MODEL (PUBLICLY INFERRED)

* **Consumer**

  * Key actions: search/browse; view business profile; book; pay online (where enabled); cancel online via Fresha account
  * Key screens: marketplace directory; business profile; booking flow; account booking management (implied) ([Fresha][1])

* **Business owner/admin (Partner)**

  * Key actions: create workspace; publish/unlist online profile; manage services/team/calendar/clients; configure payments & policies; view wallet & fee statements; manage plan/subscription
  * Key screens: partner sign-in; billing; payments; wallet; online profile tools ([partners.fresha.com][3])

* **Staff member**

  * Key actions: view/manage appointments; deliver services; take payments/checkout; (possibly) receive routed payments in multi-merchant setup
  * Key screens: calendar/appointments; checkout; payments tools ([Fresha][13])

* **“Merchant” (payments account holder)**

  * Key actions: manage merchant account/wallet transfers (personal vs workspace wallets)
  * Key screens: merchant account management (KB) ([Fresha][25])

---

## F) TRUST & QUALITY CONTROLS

* **Ratings & reviews** are prominent on directory pages and act as a primary trust signal. ([Fresha][1])
* **Payment security controls:** clients may be required to complete **two-step verification (3D Secure)** when booking online, depending on bank requirements. ([Fresha][19])
* **Cancellation/no-show protections:** businesses can configure **upfront payments/deposits** and **late cancellation/no-show fees**; group appointment logic is documented. ([Fresha][13])
* **Marketplace fee “gaming” controls:** fee logic persists across reschedules/unmanaged bookings; online client cancellation changes fee timing (defer vs charge), which incentivizes clean self-service behavior. ([Fresha][5])

---

## G) MONETIZATION DETAILS (AS PRECISE AS POSSIBLE)

**1) Marketplace New Client Fee (core marketplace monetization)**

* **What it is:** a **one-time charge per new client from the marketplace**. ([Fresha][16])
* **When it applies:** when a client **discovers the business through the Fresha Marketplace** (not through direct booking links, website buttons, or social channels). ([Fresha][18])
* **How it’s calculated:** based on the **value of the booking made online** by the brand-new client;

  * applies to **discounted price** if discount is pre-defined online;
  * does **not** apply to extra services/products added later at in-store checkout. ([Fresha][5])
* **Fee rate + minimum:** explicitly stated as “find the fee rate and minimum fee on our pricing page” (rate/min not visible in the public KB article itself). ([Fresha][5])
* **Where it appears:** charged amounts show in **business wallet** and wallet statements. ([Fresha][5])
* **Key edge cases:**

  * If **client cancels online** via Fresha account → fee **not charged then**, **deferred** to their next appointment value. ([Fresha][5])
  * If **business cancels on client’s behalf**, or booking is **unmanaged/rescheduled**, fee can still apply. ([Fresha][5])
  * Importing existing clients before going live helps ensure they’re recognized as returning clients (reducing unnecessary new-client fees). ([Fresha][23])

**2) Payments fees / payments product**

* Fresha Payments supports online + in-person methods and routes proceeds into the business wallet; “full list of rates” is referenced on the pricing page. ([Fresha][4])
* Payment tooling includes Tap to Pay, terminals, saved cards, self-checkout links, QR code payments, and split payments (feature surfaces that typically increase payment attach). ([Fresha][4])

**3) Subscription/plan billing**

* Businesses can manage/cancel their plan; cancellation removes access to workspace and unlists marketplace profile at the end of the billing cycle; reviews become hidden (not deleted). ([Fresha][8])

**4) Hardware/upsells**

* Card terminals are a first-class area in Payments documentation (order/activate/use), implying hardware distribution + payment volume capture. ([Fresha][4])
