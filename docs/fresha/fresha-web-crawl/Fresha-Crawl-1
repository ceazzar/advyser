A) **EXECUTIVE MAP (Flywheel & Business Model)**

* **Flywheel overview:** Fresha’s marketplace and SaaS platform create a virtuous cycle. Shoppers discover salons, spas and wellness providers through the Fresha marketplace. They search/browse, view provider profiles, select services and book online. After booking, the business manages appointments, staff schedules and client records via Fresha’s SaaS dashboard, processes payments and leverages marketing tools (e‑mails/SMS) to re‑engage clients. Returning clients rebook through the marketplace or direct links, fueling more reviews and higher ranking, which further improves discovery.
* **Demand‑side product (consumer):** A free web/mobile marketplace allowing clients to search for nearby salons, barbers, med‑spas and wellness studios. Key features include search (by treatment or venue), filtering by location/time, provider profiles with ratings/reviews, price/time information per service, booking flow with calendar slots, and booking management (reschedule/cancel). The consumer experience emphasises trust via star ratings, review counts and open hours.
* **Supply‑side product (business SaaS):** Fresha’s “Partner” platform offers businesses calendar & staff management, services catalogue, client CRM, payments/POS, marketing automation, reporting and optional capital financing. Pricing is subscription‑based (Independent/Team/Enterprise plans) plus usage fees. Businesses get a public profile on the marketplace and in‑app tools to manage appointments, collect payments (online deposits, card capture), send reminders, run marketing campaigns and view financial reports.
* **Monetization mechanisms:**

  * **Subscription plans:** Independent (A$44.95/mo), Team (A$29.95 per team member/mo) and Enterprise (custom) with free trials. These plans unlock additional calendar columns, communications allowances and support tiers.
  * **Marketplace new‑client fee:** Fresha charges a one‑time fee for each new client acquired via the marketplace. The fee is calculated on the value of the client’s first booking. It does not apply to existing clients and is capped/minimum as detailed in Fresha’s help centre.
  * **Payment processing fees:** Fresha acts as the payment processor; third‑party sources suggest ~1.2–2.5 % + fixed amount per transaction and charges for saved card or no‑show/cancellation fees.
  * **Communication & marketing charges:** Plans include a monthly allowance of free SMS messages and marketing emails; extra messages incur per‑unit fees.
  * **Capital financing:** Fresha Capital offers funding advances for eligible businesses; details are accessible from the Capital page.
  * **Additional charges:** New‑client fee is deferred if clients cancel online; no‑show and cancellation fees are charged based on payment policies.

* **Cancellation/No‑Show Policies:** Businesses can set their own cancellation window (e.g., 24–48 hrs) and deposit/capture card policies. Deposits are non‑refundable; clients may be charged late‑cancellation or no‑show fees. Clients are advised to cancel online to avoid new‑client fee charges.
* **Marketplace Quality Rules:** New‑client fee article suggests identifying marketplace new clients and verifying them; fee does not apply for existing clients imported into CRM.
* **Fraud/Spam Protections:** Not explicitly described, but deposit and card capture policies help reduce no‑shows; verifying new clients reduces fraudulent bookings.
* **Trust Signals:** Provider pages show open/closed status, location with directions, staff names, service durations/prices, and pictures; encourages transparency.
* **Policies around refunds:** Marketplace new‑client fee is non‑refundable.
