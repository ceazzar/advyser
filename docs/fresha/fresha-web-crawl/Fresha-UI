Below is a **UI‑focused replica specification** for Fresha’s core product, concentrating on visual layout, design language and component behaviour.  The aim is to provide designers and front‑end engineers with detailed guidance to recreate Fresha’s look and feel.

### A) EXECUTIVE MAP (UI‑Centric Summary)

* **Visual identity:** Fresha uses a clean, modern aesthetic with generous white space, soft gradients and rounded pill‑shaped elements.  Typography is bold and friendly; primary headings employ a heavy sans‑serif face (likely similar to Circular or Proxima Nova) with large line heights.  Secondary text is light grey, ensuring clear hierarchy.
* **Layout patterns:** Pages are centred with capped widths (~1200 px) and generous padding.  Navigation bars float at the top with plenty of breathing room.  CTAs are rounded rectangles or pills with high contrast (often black on pastel backgrounds).
* **Marketplace discovery flow:** The home page hero features a gradient background and a prominent search bar comprised of three pill‑segmented fields for treatment, location, and time.  Search results render as card‑based carousels with image thumbnails, star ratings and mini‑text.
* **Provider booking flow:** Provider pages use a breadcrumb trail at the top, followed by a masthead with large business name, rating, review count and open status.  Service lists are presented in card or list form with consistent spacing, durations and price labels, each with a “Book” pill button.
* **Business SaaS UI:** The partner landing pages employ similar gradients with large headline copy and icon‑driven feature blocks.  Pricing tables are laid out in columns with rounded cards distinguishing tiers.
* **Monetization & fees:** Pricing CTAs (“Start now”) are styled as filled rounded buttons that stand out against pastel backgrounds.  Fee explanations live in help articles with minimalist layouts.
* **Retention & marketing UI:** Marketing tools likely use dashboard patterns with charts and cards; though gated, the public pages suggest a modern SaaS design with pastel highlights and friendly illustrations.

| **Marketplace Home / Search**      | Hero section occupies ~60 % of viewport height with a lavender‑to‑pink gradient background.  The Fresha logo sits top‑left; right side hosts horizontal links (“Send a gift card”, “Log in”, “List your business”) in small sans‑serif font.  A hamburger‑style “Menu” button is a rounded pill with subtle drop shadow.  The headline “Book local selfcare services” uses bold large type (~48–56 pt).  Beneath lies a three‑segment search bar: each segment is a white rounded pill with icons (magnifying glass, location pin, calendar), separated by thin vertical dividers; the bar sits atop a light box with drop shadow.  The “Search” button is a black pill with white text, right‑aligned in the bar.  A statistic (“148,342 appointments booked today”) appears below in smaller dark text, followed by a secondary CTA pill (“Get the app”) with border only.                        | Search bar’s “Search” button uses a black fill; segments use input fields with placeholder text.  Secondary CTA is a border‑only pill linking to app download. |
| **Recommended & New Carousels**    | Below the hero, horizontal carousels display cards for businesses.  Each card has a rectangular image with rounded corners, business name in bold, star rating with small star icon, review count in parentheses, location text and category.  The carousel has arrow buttons (circular with chevron) for navigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Each card is itself clickable.  Carousel arrow buttons appear on hover and use minimalist outlines.                                                            |
| **Provider Listing/Profile**       | Top area includes breadcrumb navigation (small grey text links separated by chevrons) and large business name (bold ~32 pt).  Ratings appear as a black‑text number next to a clickable review count link; status (“Open until 6:00 pm”) is indicated by a small coloured dot and text.  Address is shown with a pin icon and a “Get directions” link.  Favourite button is a heart icon that requires login; styled as an outlined circle.  Service sections are tabbed by staff names; selecting a tab shows a list of services with card‑like containers: service title, duration on the next line in lighter text, price aligned to the right, and a thin line dividing services.  “Book” buttons are small pills with black text on white.  A sticky “Book now” bar appears at the bottom of the viewport when scrolling, using a filled black pill with white text, anchored for easy access. | Book buttons use border‑only or filled styling depending on context.  “See all services” link uses underline on hover.                                         |
| **Booking Flow (Wizard)**          | Multi‑step wizard uses a horizontal progress indicator showing steps (“Services”, “Professional”, “Time”, “Confirm”), with current step bolded and upcoming steps greyed.  Each step appears in its own panel with large section headings.  Service selection lists use checkbox‑style toggles; when a user selects an item, the checkbox fills with a tick and the card gets a subtle highlight.  The panel has a sticky header with back arrow and close X icons.  At the bottom, a summary bar shows selected services and total price (“Total free” when none), anchored in a card with slight shadow.  Colours: white backgrounds on cards, light grey separators; accent colour (e.g., pastel purple/blue) for active step.                                                                                                                                                                   | A button at bottom right of each step (e.g., “Next” or “Confirm”) appears as a prominent pill using brand colour (black or dark accent).                       |
| **Login/Signup Page (Consumer)**   | The login page (not fully accessed) typically uses modal/popup or separate page with large buttons for sign‑in methods.  Expect rounded buttons with provider logos (Google/Apple), and minimalist forms for email login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Primary sign‑in button uses brand colour; secondary options are outlined.                                                                                      |
| **Gift Card Page**                 | Likely uses large product card images with pastel backgrounds and prominent “Buy gift card” pill.  The design is consistent with the marketplace theme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | CTA uses filled pill, centred on page.                                                                                                                         |
| **Marketplace Category/Directory** | Category landing pages use large headings (“Hair Salons in Melbourne”) with breadcrumb navigation.  A grid of provider cards is shown, each card similar to carousel cards but arranged in responsive rows.  Filters appear as dropdown chips across the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Each provider card clickable.

| **Partner Landing (For Business)** | Hero uses gradient backgrounds similar to marketplace but uses more neutral blues/purples.  Top navigation includes links “Payments”, “Capital”, “Pricing” and “Sign up”.  Headline (“The #1 software for Salons and Spas”) uses large bold text (~48 pt).  Sub‑headline is lighter grey.  CTAs: “Get started now” (filled pill, dark) and “Watch an overview” (ghost button).  Feature statistics (e.g., “130,000+ partner businesses”) appear in a four‑column grid with numbers in bold and labels underneath.  Sections alternate white and light grey backgrounds with icons and text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Primary CTA is a dark pill; secondary CTA uses ghost styling.                                                                                                  |

Layout continues with section blocks and illustrative icons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Minimal CTA; focus is informational.                                                                                                                           |
| **Help Centre Articles**           | Minimalist layout using left‑aligned headings and content with plenty of white space.  Links and bullet lists emphasise key points.  Colours are restrained; icons may denote warnings or important information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No CTA besides navigation.                                                                                                                                     |

### C) CORE FLOW MAPS (UI PERSPECTIVE)

**C1) Consumer Marketplace Loop (UI)**

1. **Discovery (Home)** – User sees hero with gradient background and a search bar composed of three pill inputs and a black “Search” button.  CTA bar sits above statistic text.  Recommended providers appear in horizontal carousels with arrow buttons.
2. **Search/Browse** – Results page features a header with search filters as pill chips.  Providers are shown in cards with images (rounded corners), star icons, review counts and service tags.  Pagination or infinite scroll used; navigation remains sticky at top.
3. **Provider Profile** – Breadcrumb bar top, followed by large header block with name, rating, review link and open status indicator.  Service lists are divided by staff tabs; each service row has price on the right and a small “Book” pill.  The page uses plenty of margin and subtle lines to separate content.
4. **Pick Service & Choose Time (Booking Wizard)** – Wizard displays steps horizontally at top; each panel scrolls if content long.  Service selection uses card lists with checkboxes; time selection uses calendar grid or scrolling list of available times.  Buttons to proceed are anchored bottom-right in a sticky bar.
5. **Confirm** – Final step summarises booking details in a clean card; input fields (name, email, notes) use rounded rectangular text boxes.  Payment method selection uses radio buttons or card icons.  Confirm button is large and dark, spanning full width of summary bar.

**C2) Business Ops Loop (UI)**

1. **Onboard Business** – Sign‑up page likely uses multi‑step form with progress indicator; fields are spaced generously with floating labels.  Buttons use brand colours; optional field hints appear in small grey text.
2. **Add Staff / Services** – Dashboard uses card or list views with buttons like “Add staff” or “Add service” positioned top-right.  Each staff row shows avatar, name, contact and availability toggles; services editor uses modal with form fields (service name, duration, price).
3. **Calendar Management** – A full‑width calendar grid shows staff columns horizontally; bookings appear as rounded rectangles coloured by status.  Toolbar at top features date picker and navigation arrows.
4. **Client CRM** – List of clients presented in table form with rows separated by light lines; columns for name, phone, last visit.  Search bar at top; add/import buttons styled as small pills.
5. **Payments/POS** – Checkout screen uses large keypad or product/service list; totals displayed in prominent text.  Payment button styled as high-contrast pill; options for payment method icons.
6. **Marketing** – Campaign builder uses wizard-like steps; templates displayed as cards with preview images; segmentation filters appear as drop-down chips.  Sending button emphasised via colour.
7. **Reporting** – Dashboard with charts (bar/line) inside card components; filter controls at top.  Colour palette uses brand accent colours on white backgrounds.

**C3) Money + Attribution Loop (UI)**

* **Fee visibility:** Marketplace new‑client fees are not shown to consumers; they appear in business wallet transaction tables.  The wallet UI likely uses a ledger-like table with columns (Date, Type, Client, Amount).
* **Processing fees:** Payment processing fees are baked into transaction summaries; net payout shown in bold with a tooltip explaining deductions.
* **No‑Show/Cancellation Fees:** When marking an appointment, a modal pops up with checkboxes for “Late cancellation fee” and fields to confirm amount; styled like Fresha’s forms with rounded buttons.

---

### D) DATA/OBJECT MODEL (UI RELEVANT HINTS)

* **Consistent card shapes:** All major objects (business, service, plan) appear in card containers with ~8–12 px corner radius and subtle shadows.
* **Chip components:** Used for filters, tag labels and plan feature lists; have light grey backgrounds and pill shape.
* **Icons:** Minimal line icons accompany labels (search, location, calendar).  Heart icons toggle favourite state; star icons show ratings.
* **Colour palette:** Pastel gradients (lavender, pink, blue) for backgrounds; black or dark grey for primary text; light grey for secondary; accent colours (purple/blue) for steps or active tabs.

---

### E) ROLE & PERMISSION MODEL (UI IMPACT)

* **Consumer:** Interacts mostly with public UI; limited editing capability; can favourite businesses (heart icon), manage bookings (through simple dashboards with action buttons) and write reviews (star rating interface).
* **Business Owner/Admin:** Access to complex dashboards; UI emphasises management tools (side navigation bar with icons, top tabs).  Additional settings and analytics appear in nested menus.
* **Staff Member/Receptionist:** Calendar views and appointment cards dominate their screens; allowed actions appear as buttons inside booking detail modals.  Permissions hide financial settings and marketing sections.

---

### F) TRUST & QUALITY CONTROLS (UI)

* Reviews & ratings shown prominently using star icons and number of reviews; clicking opens modal or page listing reviews with user names and dates.
* Cancellation and no‑show policy details appear in fine print during booking confirmation; a link or tooltip icon opens a modal explaining fees and timeframes.
* Verification or trust badges are minimal; the open/closed indicator uses a coloured dot (green or red) next to business status text.
* Client confirmations require ticking checkboxes for agreeing to policies; these are styled as round toggles.

---

### G) MONETIZATION DETAILS (UI)

* Pricing tiers shown as equal‑sized cards with soft shadows and a pastel highlight on the recommended tier.  The price is large and bold; inclusions listed with small tick icons.
* The marketplace new‑client fee is explained in help articles rather than surfaces within booking UI; it’s not displayed to consumers.
* Payment processing fees not shown in consumer UI; business UI likely includes fee breakdown within reports.
* Marketing allowances are displayed in plan descriptions as small bullet points.

---

### H) INSTRUMENTATION EVENTS (UI HOOKS)

* Event handlers should be attached to search inputs (onChange and onSearch), carousel navigation arrows, service “Book” buttons, wizard navigation, favourite toggles, plan CTA buttons and form submissions.
* Ensure tracking for UI states (e.g., opening/closing mobile menu, toggling staff tabs, playing video overview).

### APPENDIX (UI OBSERVATIONS)

* **Screenshot reference** – The hero section of the marketplace home is captured in the provided screenshot.  Note the gradient, typography scale, pill‑segmented search bar and spacing for accurate reproduction.
* **Non‑core UI pages** – Terms and cookie modals use full‑screen overlays with centred cards and rounded action buttons; cookie banner offers “Only necessary”, “Preferences”, “Accept all” options in pill buttons.
* **Patterns for reuse** – Fresha consistently uses pill‑shaped buttons, rounded card corners, soft drop shadows and pastel gradients.  Maintaining these patterns across screens ensures visual coherence.
